# 🛰️ Reconnaissance (Information Gathering) Challenge  

Welcome to the **Recon Challenge** – a hands-on exercise to practice the **first phase of Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing: Reconnaissance**.  

In cybersecurity, reconnaissance (or "reco") is about gathering as much information as possible about a target **before exploitation**.  
This repository contains the **task description, challenge URL, and submission details**.

## 📌 What is Reconnaissance?  
Reconnaissance is the process of **collecting intelligence about a target system, network, or individual**.  
It is usually divided into two categories:  

- **Passive Recon** 🕵️ – Information gathering without direct interaction with the target.  
  Examples: Google search, WHOIS lookup, social media profiling, job postings, etc.  

- **Active Recon** ⚡ – Direct interaction with the target to gather details.  
  Examples: Port scanning, service enumeration, ping sweeps, subdomain brute forcing.  

👉 Goal: To **map the target’s digital footprint** (IPs, domains, emails, subdomains, services, technologies, people, etc.).
